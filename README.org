* STARTED Introduction

  The ~protocol.language-server~ library provides a Common Lisp
  implementation of the server role of the [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification][language server
  protocol]]. To be clear: this library does not implement a language
  server for Common Lisp, but it could be used to implement one.
